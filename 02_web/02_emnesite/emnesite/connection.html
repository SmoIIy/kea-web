                <h2 style="font-size: 4vh;">Interest</h2>
                <p>In the fall of 2015, i watched 'Blade Runner (1982) for the first time. I remember being confused about the story, but completely enthralled by the visuals, and especially the music. </p>
                <p>This was the first time i was introduced to the genre, together with the visual style of it. In my opinion, it's the music genre, where a visual style is most closely connected - maybe together with goth/punk rock. And it has stuck with me ever since. I feel that it is very hard to explain whats to enticing about it. Trying to describe it, i can't get around talking about science fiction movies. The emotions that either evoke, are complex and personal, but they are often aligned. </p>
                <p>A sense of nostalgia, of wonder and feeling completely insignificant - all at the same time. It is a very odd sensation indeed</p>
                <br>
                <p>As of artist that i enjoy in the genre, i can mention The Midnight, HOME, Starcadian - as well as lots of film scores.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 4vh;">My own song</h2>
                <p>My little brother has created music for many years - and in the beginning of 2021, that inspired me. So i went out and bought my own midi keyboard and downloaded Fruity Loops Studio for my PC - and i set out to create a synthwave album, before the end of 2021.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Unfortunately, it didnt go exactly as planned. I lost focus a lot, and even forgot about the project for long periods of time. I did however end up with two songs. One which wasnt finished, and was really bad. The other one though, i ended up releasing, and you can listen to it in the embedded links. </p>
